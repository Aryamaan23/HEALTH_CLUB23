### Project Description
To help out people we have desinged Health Club where people can get prediction of diseases with the help of machine learning beforehand so that they can start proper medication at the right time. We believe there is more to health than healthcare and weâ€™re fundamentally rethinking how healthcare organizations and communities work together to help people thrive. We came up with the solution that everyone should be able to keep a check on his/her health .We know how a disease inflicts pain to a human body, which is why we work so hard to get accurate predictions and support you. As a team we have blended the ingredients of a great user experience and a swift prediction system which might help save lives.During the pandemic it was observed that patients suffering from coronary diseases couldn't visit the hospitals due to various reasons.
